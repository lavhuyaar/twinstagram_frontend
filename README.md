## Personal words hehe

I loved this project, tried to achieve all I wanted to achieve. Even implemented a simple pagination and search feature.

Just so you know, I DO NOT use Instagram, so I had to ask a friend to give me his Instagram account so that I can clone some of it's UI and understand how things work.

Did a good work Lav. Proud of you, even implemented HTTP only Cookie for security (due to which the website won't work with Brave's shields on, but I can let that thing slide).
